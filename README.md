The Department of Nursing at Ariel University trains about 100 students every year.
The student performs theoretical training as well as clinical experiences in hospitals and clinics all over the country.
The student is given an experience according to his personal needs as much as possible when the main parameter for scheduling is based on his place of residence.

### <ins> Project Goal <img src = "https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/1534/1534999.png" height="35" width="35"> </ins>

The project is designed to support nursing students, with a special focus on automated scheduling.
Students and staff of the Department of Nursing at Ariel University are the target audience.
The system comes to upgrade the process that is being carried out today, instead of inlaying in Excel tables and investing a lot of time, the system will execute the processes automatically. 
The system will use fair distribution algorithms to schedule all students optimally based on location and distance from the place of experience.
